COVID 19 Detection Using Lung X Ray Images
Project Overview

This research project focuses on detecting COVID 19 using chest X ray images with the help of machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system analyzes lung X ray images to classify them as COVID 19 positive normal or pneumonia. The goal is to support early diagnosis using an automated and non invasive approach.
